## Introduction

* There are many types of data that can be brought into GIS.

* The “type” introduced in this tutorial refers to the different data models that can usually be discovered from a geodata portal or other data portal sites. Or, the data models that GIS professionals usually use to collect and share information.

* It doesn’t refer to the topic, content, or the purpose of the information, the information source, or any other aspects.

## Geospatial Information Types

* GIS data are usually stored in one of the following data models
  * Vector
  * Raster
  * Tabular
* Geospatial information can be found from scanned maps
* GIS data can be hosted online using web services

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Vector</td>
    <td rowspan="4">Web Services</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Raster</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tabular</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scanned Map</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Vector Data

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="color:red;">Vector</th>
    <td rowspan="4">Web Services</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Raster</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tabular</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scanned Map</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* Vector data are comprised of vertices and lines (or arcs), represented explicitly in the form of XY coordinates.
* The 3 basic geometry types for vector data are:
  * Points - XY coordinates
    * Example: cities, schools, incident locations
  * Lines - connecting the points in a set order
    * Example: roads, streams
  * Polygons - a set of points in a particular order and
Close it (the 1st and last point are the same)
    * Example: a state, county, or census block
* Most GIS applications do not allow mixed geometry type
