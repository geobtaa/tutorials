These users may have encountered web services for GIS in formats like WMS, WMTS, or WFS, but are unsure of how to use them. This tutorial is meant to introduce users to these formats, demonstrate how to find them in the BTAA Geoportal, and show how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro.
