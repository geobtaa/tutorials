Overview of Georeferencing Georeferencing is a commonly used tool to accurately digitize data on a paper map. It uses a series of control points in the digital image to associate this image with spatial locations. The digital image could be an aerial photography, a scanned map, or a picture of a topographic map. The georeferenced map can be used for basic map analysis, such as calculating distances and areas. In this tutorial, you will learn how to georeference a historical map by using ArcMap. Download Data Open BTAA geoportal: https://geo.btaa.org/ Search term \u201cHyde Park Community\u201d Click Original Jpeg button to open the map Right click the map and save image as \u201cG4104-C6-2H9-1920z-U5.jpg\u201d Data Processing Open ArcMap Click Add Basemap and choose Streets map Zoom in to the study area: Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois Add Basemap and Zoom to Hyde Park Click Add data and choose the image \u201cG4104-C6-2H9-1920z-U5.jpg\u201d Click Customize -> Toolbar -> Georeferencing to add georeferenced tool Click Fit To Display to show the image in the study area. Fit Scanned Map to Display Right click Layers -> Properties and select WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere as the coordinate system. Set Coordinate System Click Viewer to show the image in a new window. Click Add control Points to select control points. Select control points from the viewer window, and then choose the corresponding location in the street map. Add Control Points Select control points in the area close to the four corners of the map. Select additional control points. The more points you assign the more accurate your georeferenced map will be. More Control Points Tips Here are some tips for choosing control points: The number of control points needed depends on the image being used. Normally, at least four control points are required for georeferencing. Choose road crossings or sidewalk intersections, because the edges of roads may change over time. The control points should be spread across the unreferenced image. Click View Link Table. It is up to you to determine the acceptable residual values. If a link has a residual value much larger than others, the link should be deleted. Residual Values After georeferencing, click Rectify to save the result. In the layer property, change transparency to 50%. It is an easy to compare the georeferenced map locations with the real world locations.

Note for Instructors This tutorial is intended for GIS users with an established cursory understanding of how to use GIS software for visualizing spatial data and making maps, regardless of whether they are graduate, undergraduate, or faculty/staff users. These users may have encountered web services for GIS in formats like WMS, WMTS, or WFS, but are unsure of how to use them. This tutorial is meant to introduce users to these formats, demonstrate how to find them in the BTAA Geoportal, and show how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro. For an extra challenge involving the use of ArcGIS Feature Services to create a web map with Leaflet , please follow the link to my tutorial on GitHub . These slides walk through the steps of loading an ArcGIS Feature Service in several of the most commonly used GIS platforms. Please use the links provided on the Loading Web Services: Menu page to jump to the appropriate slides for your preferred software. The tutorial was designed for in-person, hybrid, and online instructional contexts. The self-guided review activity can be assigned to be completed after class, or as a live activity where students can pose questions to the instructor and other students, in person or through a chat window, as they work through it. Learning Objectives Through completing this tutorial, students will: Learn the basics of GIS web services - What are they? What kind of data do they host? What are the benefits and drawbacks? Locate and load an ArcGIS Feature Service with the BTAA Geoportal and their preferred GIS software. Find and load their own web service through the BTAA Geoportal and consider the utility of their data to different kinds of users. Intro to Web Services Several types of web services available to GIS users that serve geospatial data in different formats from web servers. As documented in the tutorial, Types of Geospatial Information by Nicole Kong, geospatial data for web services fall into four categories: vector, raster, tabular, and scanned maps. For this exercise, we will focus on the categories below: Data Type What is it? Relevant Web Service Vector Discrete points, lines, or polygons WFS/ArcGIS Feature Service Raster Continuous pixelated data with each pixel assigned a value WMS/ArcGIS Map Service Scanned Map A scanned sheet map in image format WMTS/ArcGIS Tiled Map Service Effective use of all these services will likely save you a lot of time downloading, cleaning, processing, and managing your data. Web Feature Service (WFS) Features: Direct access to vector data curated by the organization hosting the data. You will not need to join tabular data from one source to shapefiles from another source, and you will often have a direct connection to consistently updated data. Drawbacks: Updates to the tables are dependent upon the host. What happens if the server goes down or the data cease to be updated? For regularly updated data, it can be difficult to determine all possible values for classification purposes, if only a portion are used frequently, and the metadata are not very detailed. Web Map Service (WMS) Features: Renders geospatial data as map images. Similar benefits to WFS.

The \u201ctype\u201d introduced in this tutorial refers to the different data models that can usually be discovered from a geodata portal or other data portal sites. Or, the data models that GIS professionals usually use to collect and share information. It doesn\u2019t refer to the topic, content, or the purpose of the information, the information source, or any other aspects. BTAA Geoportal Project Glossary of Terms https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/about/project-documents/glossary Geospatial Information Types GIS data are usually stored in one of the following data models Vector Raster Tabular Geospatial information can be found from scanned maps GIS data can be hosted online using web services Vector Web Services Raster Tabular Scanned Map Vector Data Vector Web Services Raster Tabular Scanned Map Vector data are comprised of vertices and lines (or arcs), represented explicitly in the form of XY coordinates. The 3 basic geometry types for vector data are: Points - XY coordinates Example: cities, schools, incident locations Lines - connecting the points in a set order Example: roads, streams Polygons - a set of points in a particular order and close it (the 1st and last point are the same) Example: a state, county, or census block Most GIS applications do not allow mixed geometry type In a single layer Vector Data Types *Used by permission of Paul Bolstad, GIS Fundamentals Each vector feature has attribute data that describe it. Attribute Data Vector data are usually saved as a shapefile or a feature class in a geodatabase (In Arc/Info (1980-1999), it can also be saved in coverage format). Vector symbology: Single Symbol Categorical Symbol Quantitative Symbol Raster Data Vector Web Services Raster Tabular Scanned Map Raster data is made up of pixels with each pixel has its own Value. Raster data is usually used to represent surfaces. Raster data model is commonly used for digital elevation models (DEM), aerial and satellite imagery, and land use land cover maps. Raster data resolution: cell dimension, or the size of pixels. Raster images can consume a large amount of storage space. Raster Data Types *Used by permission of Paul Bolstad, GIS Fundamentals Two types of raster data: continuous and discrete Discrete rasters have distinct themes or categories. Each class can be discretely defined, usually ba integer values. Example, land cover/use map. Continuous rasters are grid cells with gradual changing data such as elevation and temperature. Continuous and Categorical Data *Used by permission of Paul Bolstad, GIS Fundamentals Raster data are usually saved in the format of raster dataset, GeoTIFF, or many other formats. Vector vs. Raster Vector Raster Positional Precision Can be precise Defined by cell size Attribute Precision Poor for continuous data Good for continuous data Output Quality Very good, map like Fair to poor, depending on resolution Data Structure Often complex Often quite simple Storage Requirement Relatively small Often quite large Spatial Analysis Good topology relationship Good for modeling Tabular Data Vector Web Services Raster Tabular Scanned Map Tables with geospatial information can be used for mapping purpose in GIS. Tables with information that can be joined with an existing map Reference: Tutorial about table join Tables with XY coordinate information Tables with address information Geocoding Scanned Maps Vector Web Services Raster Tabular Scanned Map A scanned map stored as an image file. Georeferenced scanned map: has a linked file that stores spatial information so that it can be overlayed with other digital maps in GIS. Usually stored as GeoTIFF. Un-georeferenced scanned map: The presence of coordinates in the record\u2019s metadata does not make the map georeferenced. Can be saved as TIFF or JPG, etc. A Scanned Map Web Services - GIS Vector Web Services Raster Tabular Scanned Map A streaming GIS layer that can be viewed and queried in a browser or GIS application. Types of GIS web services - they are often provided using either Esri format or open standard defined by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Esri ArcGIS Dynamic Map Layer Service Vector data. Map image layers are dynamically rendered. ArcGIS Feature Layer Service Displays vector data as individual or collected features. ArcGIS Image Map Layer Service Displays raster data (a grid of cells used to store imagery). ArcGIS Tiled Map Layer Service Displays set of web-accessible tiles that reside on a server. OGC Web Mapping Service (WMS) Renders a geospatial dataset as map images. Web Feature Service (WFS) Serves queryable geographic features. IIIF International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Displays an image from a server. This image can be panned and zoomed. How to Find These Data in the BTAA Geoportal The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal connects users to digital geospatial resources, including GIS datasets , web services , and digitized historical maps from multiple data clearinghouses and library catalogs.
